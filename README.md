- A Keras regression model that predicts the chances of being admitted to a school can be highly valuable and impactful for several reasons:

**Data-Driven Decision Making**: Admissions processes are often complex and involve multiple factors. A regression model can analyze historical data of past applicants and their outcomes, identifying patterns and correlations between various admission criteria and the likelihood of acceptance. This data-driven approach can help schools make more informed decisions about candidate selection.

**Fairness and Transparency**: Machine learning models like Keras regression models can be designed to reduce bias and increase fairness in the admissions process. By focusing on objective criteria, the model can avoid subjective judgments that may inadvertently lead to discrimination or unfair treatment.

**Resource Optimization**: With limited seats and resources, schools need to optimize their admissions process to select candidates who are most likely to succeed and contribute positively to the institution. A regression model can prioritize applicants based on their predicted chances of success, maximizing the utilization of available resources.
